# Devfolio Jr üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Devfolio Jr is a React app that closely mimics the design and functionality of Devfolio, built within a sprint of 24 hours. It utilizes various React libraries and exact SVGs commonly used in website development.

## Features

1) Tried to make it as close to the original Devfolio website as possible, including headers, footers, body, search bar, and behavior of icons.
2) Implemented a search bar with Ctrl+K feature to mimic the original Devfolio's search functionality.
3) Linked recently added hackathons with hyperlinks and social handles by scraping data to replicate the dynamic content of Devfolio.
4) Added personal portfolio links, technical articles, and a chatbot for resume inquiries to enhance the user experience and provide additional features similar to 
   Devfolio.
